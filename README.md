Module 1: Responsive design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Intro to modern coding

In Module 1 you will learn the foundations of Web Development: HTML and CSS basics, responsive web design using Flexbox and Bootstrap, and JS basics, together with the core concepts of object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, and version control. However, JavaScript will be your primary focus throughout your journey at Ironhack. As a full-stack JavaScript developer, you will need to understand this language like it’s your native tongue, so prepare yourself for rigorous days learning the most widely used coding language on earth.

The game

For your first project, you will code a game using the skills you learned in Module 1. Deeply familiarize yourself with JavaScript basics and take your knowledge to the next level by developing your own game. Want to build your favorite childhood game? Pacman? Street Fighter? Asteroids? Recreate classics with your own personal twist, or maybe even create your own original game — it’s up to you!


Module 2: The back-end
Try your hand at NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB

Dive into the back-end world through your work in Module 2. You will learn how the model-view-controller design pattern works and how to create a server using NodeJS, ExpressJS and Handlebars. You’ll also learn about MongoDB, a non-relational database, as well as Mongoose, an object-data-modeling library that provides a rigorous modeling environment for your data. Perhaps these words are still mysterious to you now, but by the end of Module 2 your evolution into a full-stack MERN developer will almost be complete. M stands for MongoDB, E stands for ExpressJS, R stands for React (more about this in Module 3) and N stands for NodeJS. In the last phase of this module, you will learn how to make HTTP requests with Axios, integrate APIs into your application and deploy them to production.

Full-stack web application

Finish Module 2 by combining all of the technologies you’ve just learned — NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB, along with Mongoose and many other packages — to create a full-stack web application. You’ll use external APIs in your application, giving you a taste of how applications are built in the real world. Finally, to make the whole process more fun and practical, you will complete this project with a partner. Tech companies commonly utilize pair programming, so you will accrue excellent working experience for the jobs you’ll land after bootcamp!


Module 3: The front-end
Learn ReactJS

In the final module, you will begin to master one of the most widely used front-end frameworks: ReactJS. Concepts such as single page app (SPA) and component-based frameworks will become second nature to you. By the end of the module, you will be well-versed in technology that is utilized by some of the largest tech companies in the world. Developed by Facebook engineers, ReactJS is maintained by Facebook as well as a community of individual developers and companies.

MERN web application

Wrap everything up in the last project! Here you will get to utilize all of the skills you’ve accumulated throughout the bootcamp. You will create a full-stack application incorporating your back-end knowledge of NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB as well as creating a SPA by using ReactJS and your front-end skills. Deploying an application with a solid user experience will be a breeze with your combined MERN abilities. Showing that you can build your own full-stack application will give you a head-start when looking for jobs, because companies know you have the skills to deliver what their users around the world need today.
